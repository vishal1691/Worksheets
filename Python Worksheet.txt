11. Difference between a List, tuple, set and dictionary

List - 
List is a collection which is ordered.
Lists are mutable (changeable) .
Allows duplicate members
Brackets used to represent: []
Lists are like arrays declared in other languages.
Tuples

Tuple - 
Collection of items which is ordered.
Tuples are immutable (unchangeable) .
Brackets used to represent: ()
Only difference between tuples and lists are that lists can be changed.
Tuples are faster than lists as they are immutable.
Sets

Set -
Collection of Unordered and Unindexed items.
Sets are mutable (changeable).
Does not take duplicate Values.
Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
Brackets used to represent: { }.
Sets are not faster than lists however they have a upper hand when it comes to membership testing.
Dictionaries.

Dictionary - 
Key:Value Pair in Python
A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed.
In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.
Brackets used to represent: {}

12. In Python, the string data types are immutable, it means the string value cannot be updated. 

Replace '+' with space in Python - 

txt = "I+Love+Python"

x = txt.replace(" +", " ")

print(x)


13. The ord() function in Python accepts a string of length 1 as an argument and returns the unicode code point representation of the passed argument. 
Example of ord function

For example ord('B') returns 66 which is a unicode code point value of character 'B'.

Function for getting the datatype of a variable in Python - 

def type: 
   int = 123
   print(type(int))
